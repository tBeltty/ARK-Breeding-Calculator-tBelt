# ARK Breeding Calculator (Unofficial) v2.5.2
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
A modernized, high-performance remake of the classic ARK Breeding Calculator, built for **ARK: Survival Ascended (ASA)** and **ARK: Survival Evolved (ASE)**.

Original concept by Crumplecorn, re-engineered for 2026. **Version 2.5.2** (Released Jan 2026).


## 🚀 Why this Remake?

The original tools were built on aging technologies (AngularJS 1.x) that are hard to maintain and lack support for modern web features. This project aims to:
- **Modernize the Stack**: Migrated to **React 19 + Vite** for blazing fast performance.
- **Improve UX**: Implemented the **Atmos UI** design system for a premium, responsive, and accessible experience.
- **Updated Content**: Includes the latest official creatures from recent DLCs (e.g., **Gloon**, **Ossidon**).
- **Maintainability**: Refactored the codebase to be robust, testable, and extensible.

## ✨ Experience the Difference

### 🚀 Seamless Onboarding
Get started in seconds with our new **Smart Setup Wizard**.
- **Personalized Setup**: Select your language, game version (ASE/ASA), and preferred theme instantly.
- **Interactive Guide**: The app helps you create your first creature session so you're never lost.
- **Smart Defaults**: We pre-configure settings based on your choices for immediate utility.

### 🦕 Professional Creature Management
Our **Signature Feature**. Why settle for tracking one baby when you can manage an army?
- **Multi-Dino Tracking**: Monitor an entire nursery from a unified, collapsible sidebar.
- **Real-Time Sync**: Every second counts. Maturation timers are synchronized instantly across the entire UI.
- **Smart Context**: Autosaves your progress locally—refresh without fear.

### 🧬 Precision Breeding Analytics
Stop guessing. Start calculating.
- **Calculations**: Maturation times, food consumption, and stat points based on official rates.
- **Survival Buffer**: The classic "Current Buffer" metric tells you how long you can step away.
- **Hand-Feed Thresholds**: Know the exact second your baby handles a trough.

### 🥩 Intelligent Trough Simulation
Optimize your resources and sleep soundly.
- **Multi-Trough Logic**: Simulates complex setups with Tek Troughs and Fridges.
- **Maewing Support** (Beta): Experimental support for nursing trough mechanics.
- **Spoilage Engine**: Accounts for variable spoilage rates across container types.

### 🎨 Premium "Atmos" Interface
A tool that looks as good as it performs.
- **6 Hand-Crafted Themes**: From the frozen peaks of *Arat Prime* to the corrupted innovation of *Tek Pulse*.
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Modern, translucent, and highly responsive interface.
- **Mobile First**: Fully optimized for phones and tablets without compromising power.

### 🌍 Internationalization
- **Multi-language Support**: Fully localized in **English** and **Spanish**.
- **Contextual Tooltips**: Every field has a helpful tooltip explaining the game mechanic (in your language!).

### 📱 PWA Support
- **Installable**: Add to Home Screen on iOS, Android, and Desktop.
- **Offline Capable**: Works without an internet connection once loaded.
- **Auto-Updates**: Automatically keeps you on the latest version.

- **Discord Bot Integration (v3.0)**: Use slash commands (`/track`, `/stats`) to manage your nursery directly from Discord.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core**: React 19, Vite
- **State**: React Hooks (useState, useMemo, useReducer)
- **Styling**: CSS Modules, CSS Variables (Tokens)
- **Testing**: Vitest
